# Solidity Crud with Student Data

This is a simple crud application with student data. It is a simple application to understand the basic of solidity.


## Installation

Use pip to install the dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

you need to use ganache to run the smart contract. You can download ganache from [here](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
and deploy the smart contract to the ganache network.
I have put the smart contract in the `solidity` folder.


```python
python app.py # to run the application
```
